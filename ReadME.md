# Personalized Content Description Generator

A minimal, single-file implementation that uses NVIDIA NeMo to generate personalized content descriptions and summaries. This tool is designed to work with limited data - only requiring content names, user ratings, and watch times to generate customized descriptions that align with user preferences.

## Features

- Works with minimal user data (just content names, ratings, watch times)
- Automatically infers user preferences from viewing patterns
- Generates personalized content descriptions tailored to user interests
- Supports fine-tuning on custom examples
- Simple, self-contained implementation in a single file

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.13+
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (recommended for faster inference and required for fine-tuning)
- NVIDIA NeMo framework

## Installation

1. Install PyTorch for your CUDA version:
   ```
   pip install torch==1.13.1+cu117 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
   ```

2. Install NeMo and dependencies:
   ```
   pip install nemo_toolkit[nlp]
   ```

3. Download the script and make it executable:
   ```
   chmod +x personalized_description_generator.py
   ```

## Quick Start

### Generate a Single Description

```bash
python personalized_description_generator.py describe \
  --content "Inception" \
  --user "user123" \
  --user_data viewing_history.csv
```

### Batch Generate Descriptions

```bash
python personalized_description_generator.py generate \
  --user_data viewing_history.csv \
  --output descriptions.json \
  --limit 10
```

### Fine-tune the Model (requires GPU)

```bash
python personalized_description_generator.py finetune \
  --train_data training_examples.jsonl \
  --output_model my_finetuned_model.nemo \
  --epochs 3
```

## Input Data Format

The script expects a CSV file with user viewing data in the following format:

```
user_id,content_name,rating,watch_time_minutes
user123,Inception,4.5,120
user123,The Matrix,5.0,138
user456,Interstellar,3.5,95
```

## How It Works

1. **User Profile Creation**: 
   - Analyzes viewing history (content watched, ratings, watch times)
   - Identifies genre preferences and viewing patterns
   - Categorizes users into profile types (enthusiast, casual_viewer, etc.)

2. **Content Metadata Enrichment**:
   - Fetches or generates detailed content metadata
   - Extracts relevant content attributes (genre, plot elements, etc.)

3. **Personalized Description Generation**:
   - Creates prompts combining content info and user preferences
   - Uses NeMo's language model to generate tailored descriptions
   - Emphasizes content aspects most relevant to the user's interests

4. **Model Fine-tuning** (optional):
   - Uses examples of personalized descriptions
   - Adapts the language model to better match your specific use case

## Example Usage Scenarios

### Streaming Platform

Enhance content discovery by showing users personalized descriptions that highlight aspects of movies/shows they care about:

- For horror fans: emphasis on atmosphere and scare factors
- For character-driven viewers: focus on character development and relationships
- For action enthusiasts: highlight exciting sequences and pacing

### Content Recommendation

Improve recommendation systems by generating summaries that explain *why* a particular user might enjoy recommended content based on their specific interests and viewing patterns.

## Training Your Own Model

To train a custom model, you'll need to create a training dataset in JSONL format with prompt-completion pairs:

```jsonl
{"prompt": "Title: Inception\nYear: 2010\nGenre: Science Fiction, Action\nDirector: Christopher Nolan\nCast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page\n\nUser preferences:\nFavorite genres: Science Fiction, Mystery\nFavorite elements: mind-bending, plot-twists, philosophical\nViewer type: enthusiast\n\nCreate a personalized content description that emphasizes aspects most relevant to this user's preferences:\n", "completion": "Inception (2010) explores mind-bending concepts of shared consciousness through revolutionary dream-tech that allows skilled extractors to navigate layered dreamscapes. Director Christopher Nolan crafts a meticulously designed world where time dilates across dream levels and reality blurs, following Dom Cobb's team as they attempt the supposedly impossible task of inceptionâ€”planting an idea rather than stealing one. The film's intricate rules of dream architecture and stunning visual representations of collapsing physical laws deliver a cerebral sci-fi experience that questions the nature of reality itself."}
```
